- It was possible to install mTLS, enable it on upstreams, remove mTLS and the configuration still be defined on upstreams. This caused the data plane to become out of sync, since envoy clusters would be configured to get their secrets from a non-existent cluster. Add protection to the `glooctl istio uninject` command to prevent users from unknowingly causing the data plane to become out of sync. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4390)

#### [v1.7.0-beta13](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta13)

##### Dependency Bumps
- solo-io/skv2 has been upgraded to v0.17.2.

##### New Features
- Add ability for the Gloo Edge Enterprise external auth server to validate OAuth 2.0 access tokens based on access token scopes.  The new `requiredScopes` field of AccessTokenValidation can be used to specify a list of required scopes for a token. Omitting the field means that scope validation is skipped. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4224)

#### [v1.7.0-beta12](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta12)

#### [v1.7.0-beta11](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta11)

##### New Features
- Allow for the configuration of socket options on the envoy listener. This is useful, for example, to set TCP keep alive for downstream connections to envoy (e.g., NLB in front of envoy). (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3758)

#### [v1.7.0-beta10](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta10)

##### New Features
- Added the new `transport_api_version` field to the `extauth` settings. The field determines the API version for the `ext_authz` transport protocol that will be used by Envoy to communicate with the auth server. The currently allowed values are `V2` and `V3`, with the former being the default; this was done to maintain compatibility with existing custom auth servers. Note that in order for the external auth server to be able to emit dynamic metadata the field needs to be set to `V3`. For more info, see the `transport_api_version` field [here](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/ext_authz/v3/ext_authz.proto#extensions-filters-http-ext-authz-v3-extauthz).

#### [v1.7.0-beta5](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta5)

##### Fixes
- CPU profile of Gloo at scale (5000+ upstreams) indicated that the `generateXDSSnapshot` function was taking upwards of 5 seconds of CPU on a ~50 second sample. This change optimizes the code by using creating hashes for the XDS snapshot using deterministic proto marshalling and fnv hashing rather than the reflection-based `mitchellh/hashstructure` which was benchmarked to be several orders of magnitude slower. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4084)

#### [v1.7.0-beta4](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta4)

##### Fixes
- CPU profile of Gloo at scale (5000+ upstreams) indicated that the `endpointsForUpstream` function was taking upwards of 5 seconds of CPU on a ~50 second sample. This change optimizes the code by using a map instead of looping over all endpoints for each upstream. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4084)

#### [v1.7.0-beta3](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.7.0-beta3)

##### Helm Changes
- Add 3 configuration values under global.istioIntegration to control automatic discovery and sidecar injection for Gloo pods by Istio. LabelInstallNamespace adds a label to mark the namespace for Istio discovery if the namespace is designated to be created in the chart. WhitelistDiscovery explicitly annotates Gloo's discovery pod for Istio sidecar injection. DisableAutoinjection annotates all pods that aren't more specifically noted elsewhere never receive Istio sidecar injection. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3924)

#### [v1.6.0-beta25](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta25)

##### Upgrade Notes
- Experimental wasm features have been removed from Gloo Edge. Wasm support is now a feature of Gloo Edge Enterprise. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4025)

#### [v1.6.0-beta24](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta24)

##### Dependency Bumps
- solo-io/envoy-gloo has been upgraded to v1.17.0-rc3.

##### Fixes
- Buffer envoy filter is now added to the filter chain correctly so it can be used other than on the Gateway level. Added end-to-end tests for buffer filter. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4000)
- Disable REST EDS server by default, which is no longer necessary now that upstream envoy has fixed https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/13070 (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3805)
- Csrf envoy filter shadow mode now gets correctly applied to the envoy config. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3898)

##### Helm Changes
- Add the helm value `gatewayProxies.gatewayProxy.readConfigMulticluster`, set to false by default. Setting this to true will add a gateway-proxy-config-dump-service Service to the gloo installation namespace. This service allows multicluster management planes to access the envoy config dump on port 8082 of the gateway-proxy. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4012)

##### New Features
- Adds a new `headers_to_append` field to the HTTP request transformation API. This allows users to specify headers which can contain multiple values and to specify transformations for each of the values. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3901)

#### [v1.6.0-beta23](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta23)

##### New Features
- Add the defaultDashboardFolderId value to the settings proto definition for use in gloo-E. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3920)
- Gloo now supports enabling the upstream Envoy CSRF filter by configuring `spec.httpGateway.options.csrf` of the desired Gateway. This can also be overridden on virtual services at the virtual host or route level, and on weighted destinations. See [envoy csrf](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/csrf/v3/csrf.proto) for more details. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3898)

#### [v1.6.0-beta22](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta22)

##### Fixes
- Fix a bug where the `inheritableMatchers` value itself was being read from the parent route, rather than the child route (as documented and intended). (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4008)
- Fix generated resource clients watch functions to not block infinitely, therefore leaking go-routines. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/4001)

##### New Features
- Add support for the new `inheritablePathMatchers` value on `Route` config. This new setting is similar to the `inheritableMatchers` boolean value that allows delegated routes (i.e., routes on route tables) to optionally opt into inheriting HTTP header, method, or query parameter matching from the parent route. The new `inheritablePathMatchers` is used to optionally opt into inheriting HTTP path matcher config from the parent. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3726)

#### [v1.6.0-beta21](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta21)

##### Dependency Bumps
- solo-io/skv2 has been upgraded to v0.15.2.

##### Fixes
- Update `glooctl cluster register` and `glooctl cluster deregister` commands to use the default Kubernetes config when registering and deregistering clusters. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3972)

##### Helm Changes
- Update the version of Istio used by the Istio sidecar in the gateway-proxy pod for mTLS cert generation when the helm value global.istioSDS.enabled is set to true. New Istio version is 1.8.1. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3967)

##### New Features
- Adding case sensitivity option on the path matcher. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3976)
- Allows Jwt authentication to be compatible with other auth mechanisms in enterprise authentication. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3207)
- Introduce an API to support a passthrough grpc ext auth service. This service authorizes requests by delegating to an external service which implements the envoy external auth API: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/ae1ed1fa74f096dabe8dd5b19fc70333621b0309/api/envoy/service/auth/v3/external_auth.proto#L29


#### [v1.6.0-beta20](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta20)

##### Notes
- This release contained no user-facing changes.

#### [v1.6.0-beta19](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta19)

##### Fixes
- Ripout gogo proto in favor of golang proto (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3926)

#### [v1.6.0-beta18](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta18)

##### Dependency Bumps
- solo-io/go-utils has been upgraded to v0.20.1.

##### Fixes
- Fix the proxycontroller docs example code, and the corresponding documentation. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3941)
- fixes bug where route validation marks redirect and direct response route destinations as invalid. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3975)
- Changed Istio's default discoveryAddress used by the glooctl istio commands and helm installations when istioSDS is enabled (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3908)

##### Helm Changes
- Add a helm value for setting extauth field for gloo.solo.io.Settings. This allows to configure custom external auth server while installing Helm chart, without need to post-render or patch Settings object after helm chart was installed or upgraded. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/1892)

#### [v1.6.0-beta17](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta17)

##### Fixes
- Fixes a bug where routes that use a deleted lambda function as destination causes gloo to crash. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3895)
- When configuring tracing, you can specify a cluster where traces are collected. If the collector is an upstream, tracing works as expected. However, if the cluster is statically defined in the envoy bootstrap, traces do not get collected. This adds support for statically defined tracing collector clusters. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3954)

##### New Features
- Add the ability to configure the propagation of the tracing header x-envoy-decorator-operation, for me info: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/route/v3/route_components.proto.html?highlight=decorator#config-route-v3-decorator (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3931)

##### Notes
- _Marked as a pre-release to due a regression with redirectActions, see https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3975_

#### [v1.6.0-beta16](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta16)

##### Dependency Bumps
- solo-io/go-utils has been upgraded to v0.20.0.

##### New Features
- Add the ability to add static clusters to the envoy bootstrap config via helm. This option can be accessed via "<proxy-name>.envoyStaticClusters". The value should be a list of static clusters which will be passed directly to envoy, so the yaml must be correct. The api can be found here: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/cluster/v3/cluster.proto#config-cluster-v3-cluster. This is meant to be used for advanced use cases (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3905)
- Add the ability to add bootstrap extensions to the envoy bootstrap config via helm. This option can be accessed via "<proxy-name>.envoyBootstrapExtensions". The value should be a list of bootstrap extensions which will be passed directly envoy, so the yaml must be correct. The main use case being wasm services, for the purpose of creating singletons. Bootstrap extensions is a list of typed extension config (https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/core/v3/extension.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-config-core-v3-typedextensionconfig) so the list must be passed with the name, and type url. The API for the wasm service specfically can be found here: https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/wasm/v3/wasm.proto#extensions-wasm-v3-wasmservice. This is meant to be used for advanced use cases (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3943)

#### [v1.6.0-beta15](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta15)

##### Fixes
- In multi-proxy environments, resources that were invalid on one proxy (error or warning) but valid on another may have a status written of accepted, despite internally calculating (and logging) a warning. This is now fixed. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3935)
- cert-manager can be used to create a Certificate (https://cert-manager.io/docs/concepts/certificate/). This is used to generate a TLS key and certificate, and they are stored in a Kubernetes secret. This can be configured to include an optional property on the secret, ca.crt, which holds a root CA certificate. If cert-manager is used to generate this Kubernetes secret, and the root CA certificate is included, we were not including it when converting to a Gloo secret, causing Gloo to crash. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3652)
- Turn the certgen job into a no-op if the previously generated certs still exist, and are still valid. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3790)

##### New Features
- Add API to support optional OIDC configuration override for ext-auth. OIDC Configuration is discovered at <issuerUrl>/.well-known/openid-configuration and this configuration can override those discovered values. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3879)
- Support XDS V2/V3 APIs simultaneously from rate-limit server. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2815)

#### [v1.6.0-beta14](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta14)

##### Helm Changes
- When doing a helm install where `istioSDS.enabled` is set to `true`, the `ISTIO_META_CLUSTER_ID` environment variable is now initialized to "Kubernetes". (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3881)
- Panic mode allows Envoy load balancing to disregard host's health status. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3747)

#### [v1.6.0-beta13](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta13)

##### Dependency Bumps
- linux/alpine has been upgraded to v3.12.1.

#### [v1.6.0-beta12](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta12)

##### New Features
- Allow an external tracing provider to be configured on a listener via the Gloo API. See https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/trace/v3/http_tracer.proto#envoy-v3-api-msg-config-trace-v3-tracing-http for more details on this setting. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3762)

#### [v1.6.0-beta11](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta11)

##### New Features
- Expose envoy's cluster_header field in the gloo api See https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/route/v3/route_components.proto#envoy-v3-api-field-config-route-v3-routeaction-cluster-header for more details about this field. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3749)

#### [v1.6.0-beta10](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta10)

##### Fixes
- Disable gloo metrics service as it is unused, and CPU intensive. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3849)
- Fixed a bug where a bad authconfig which should invalidate a single virtual service was incorrectly invalidating the entire gateway (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3538)
- Fixed a bug where invalid route replacement did not correctly replace routes that referred to a missing `UpstreamGroup`, which potentially resulted in incorrect config being sent to envoy. Now, the route will be replaced correctly according to the invalid config policy. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3818)

##### New Features
- Add Istio 1.8.x support to the existing glooctl istio integrations. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3855)

#### [v1.6.0-beta9](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta9)

##### Fixes
- fixes glooctl check error messages that are displayed when deployments checks have failed (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2952)

##### New Features
- Expose the server_header_transformation setting via the Gloo API. See https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v2/config/filter/network/http_connection_manager/v2/http_connection_manager.proto for more details on this setting. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3769)

#### [v1.6.0-beta8](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta8)

##### Dependency Bumps
- solo-io/solo-apis has been upgraded to rate-limiter-v0.1.2.

##### New Features
- Define the API to allow for set-style rate limiting. The previous rate-limiting implementation uses a tree structure for descriptors. This adds capability to use a set structure instead, where the descriptors are treated as an unordered set such that a given rule will apply if all the relevant descriptors match, regardless of the values of the other descriptors and regardless of descriptor order. For example, the rule may require `type: a` and `number: 1` but the `remote_address` descriptor can have any value. This can also be understood as `remote_address: *` where * is a wildcard. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2695)

#### [v1.6.0-beta7](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta7)

##### Notes

##### Dependency Bumps
- solo-kit/solo-io has been upgraded to v0.13.14.

##### Fixes
- Fix EDS so modifying configs on a TLS enabled Upstream no longer results in 503s (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3673)
- Gloo will no longer remove upstreams after editing their spec. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3710)
- Fix EDS so modifying health checks on Upstream no longer results in 503s (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3219)
- Allow static upstream endpoints have individual SNI entries (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3806)

##### Helm Changes
- This change stops ConfigMap, Service, and Gateway objects from being created for gateway proxies if "disabled = true" under the helm chart values override. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3751)

##### New Features
- Allow toggling of EDS to rest XDS to avoid the envoy issue described in the following issue: https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/13070. Set to true by default starting in version > `v1.6.0` (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3805)

#### [v1.6.0-beta5](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta5)

##### Helm Changes
- Set route prefix_rewrite in ingress proxy and knative proxy configs from `global.glooStats.routePrefixRewrite` helm value. This allows Gloo to integrate with other monitoring systems instead of just Prometheus. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3752)
- Adds a single helm value that can be used to configure all sds/envoy-sidecar container resource usages. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2979)

#### [v1.6.0-beta4](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta4)

##### Fixes
- Fix an issue where ssl configurations across different virtual services may be incorrectly cached if they ssl configurations only differ by ssl-parameters (e.g., min tls version). **After this change, ssl configurations that are only different by ssl parameters must have different sni domains.** Prior to this change, such a configuration would not error but could result in one ssl configuration being selected over another; now an explicit error is recorded on the virtual service. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3776)
- Fix the validation API to return all errors encountered while validating a list of resources, rather than immediately returning on the first unmarshal error encountered for a resource in a list resource. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3610)
- Fix the validation API error reporting to include the resource associated with the error returned. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3610)

##### Helm Changes
- Add possibility to pass image pull secret to all deployments in helm chart (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3729)
- Add a helm value for stats prefix rewrite. This allows Gloo to integrate with other monitoring systems instead of just Prometheus, by setting the `global.glooStats.routePrefixRewrite` helm value. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3752)

#### [v1.6.0-beta3](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta3)

##### Dependency Bumps
- envoy-gloo/solo-io has been upgraded to v1.17.0-rc1.

##### Fixes
- Fix the validation API to only return proxies that would be generated by proposed resources if requested. This change means the default behavior matches the kubernetes validation webhook API. By including the top-level value `returnProxies=true` in the json/yaml request to the API, you can signal the endpoint to return the proxies that would be generated (previously, always returning by default). (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3613)

##### Helm Changes
- Removed the `global.wasm.enabled` HELM value for toggling experimental wasm support. Wasm is now enabled by default. This flag is no longer required as there is no more need for a separate gateway-proxy image since wasm support was merged into upstream envoy. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3753)
- Addresses minor issue of adding consul configs into helm. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3698)

##### New Features
- Use official wasm support from upstream envoy, rather than envoy-wasm fork. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3753)
- Allow automatic discovery of TLS when using consul services. Requires serveral changes to gloo's helm config to use:

##### Notes
- This release contained no user-facing changes.

#### [v1.6.0-beta1](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.6.0-beta1)

##### Fixes
- Ensure the rest of our docker containers run with user 10101 rather than root (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3346)
- Fix misleading message in `glooctl install` output when the install namespace already exists. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3704)

##### Helm Changes
- Fix helm chart to honor `.Values.settings.replaceInvalidRoutes` value. This change makes the default invalid route behavior match what's documented (disabled by default). To enable again, set `.Values.settings.replaceInvalidRoutes=true` (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3619)
- Remove duplicate helm values that are no longer needed to keep hook-created values in helm releases. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3498)

##### New Features
- With each release, we will additionally be publishing an alternate set of docker containers (tagged as usual but with the "-extended" suffix) that have some additional dependencies built in (e.g., `curl` for debugging). You can deploy these images by setting the helm value `global.image.extended=true`. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3399)
- Expose the max_connection_duration and max_stream_duration settings via the Gloo API. See https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/core/v3/protocol.proto#config-core-v3-httpprotocoloptions for more details on these settings. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3628)

- Fix the validation API error reporting to include the resource associated with the error returned. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3610)

#### [v1.5.1](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.5.1)

##### Fixes
- Ensure the rest of our docker containers run with user 10101 rather than root (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3346)
- With each release, we will additionally be publishing an alternate set of docker containers (tagged as usual but with the "-extended" suffix) that have some additional dependencies built in (e.g., `curl` for debugging). You can deploy these images by setting the helm value `global.image.extended=true`. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3399)
- Fixed the max_connection_duration and max_stream_duration settings not being exposed the Gloo API. See https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/config/core/v3/protocol.proto#config-core-v3-httpprotocoloptions for more details on these settings. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3628)

##### Helm Changes
- Fix helm chart to honor `.Values.settings.replaceInvalidRoutes` value. This change makes the default invalid route behavior match what's documented (disabled by default). To enable again, set `.Values.settings.replaceInvalidRoutes=true` (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3619)
- Remove duplicate helm values that are no longer needed to keep hook-created values in helm releases. Backport for v1.5. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3498)

### v1.4.0

#### [v1.4.8-patch1](https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/releases/tag/v1.4.8-patch1)

##### Fixes
- Allow compressing the spec for Proxy objects. (https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3663)
