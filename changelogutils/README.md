# Changelog

Any repository set up with the Solo bot webhook for CI and release builds can opt into 
using the automated changelog provided in this utility. The benefits of using the changelog include:

- Automatically producing the description for the github release page, and optionally the docs, with zero effort. 
- Ensuring that every change is described in the release notes, with links to Github issues.  
- Ensuring that the release notes are consistently formatted across releases and repos. 
- Ensuring that the release versions are incremented correctly according to semantic versioning. 

## Turning on Changelog

Add a top-level directory called "changelog" in the repo. This directory will ultimately contain a structure like
the following: 

```
changelog/
  v0.1.0/
    summary.md
    foo.yaml
    bar.yaml
  v0.2.0/
    foo2.yaml
  v0.2.1/
    foo3.yaml

```

Here, `v0.1.0`, `v0.2.0`, and `v0.2.1` represent released or unreleased versions of the project. The bot will 
check to make sure there is exactly one directory corresponding to an unreleased version 
(greater than the latest release tag) and that at least one new changelog file has been added.

## Changelog files

A changelog file contains a list of changelog entries, like this:

```yaml
changelog:
  - type: NEW_FEATURE
    description: Gloo releases now automatically publish a changelog to the docs.
    issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/465
  - ...
  - ...
```
 
Type must be one of `NEW_FEATURE`, `FIX`, `BREAKING_CHANGE`, `DEPENDENCY_BUMP`, `HELM`, `UPGRADE`, or `NON_USER_FACING`. 

Changelog entries that are not of type `NON_USER_FACING` or `DEPENDENCY_BUMP` must have a description and an issue link. 
Those fields are optional for `NON_USER_FACING` and `DEPENDENCY_BUMP` changes.

`DEPENDENCY_BUMP` changes have a few additional required fields: `dependencyTag`, `dependencyOwner`, and `dependencyRepo`. For example, 
this is a valid changelog file containing a dependency bump:

```yaml
changelog:
  - type: DEPENDENCY_BUMP
    description: Bumped the version of go-utils to pick up the new changelog feature.
    dependencyOwner: solo-io
    dependencyRepo: go-utils
    dependencyTag: v0.6.2
``` 

Changelog entries can set an optional boolean field called `resolvesIssue`. This can be used by CI 
systems to automatically close issues linked to the changelog. The default value for this field is `true`. 

The description field should be one or more complete sentences (starting with a capital letter, ending 
with a period). The issue link should point to a valid github URL. These conventions are currently
not validated, but may be in a future version.  

The name of the changelog filename does not matter. It is useful to pick a unique name for the PR, 
to avoid potential merge conflicts. For instance, you may add this change in a file called 
`publish_changelogs.yaml`. As long as it is valid yaml in the correct tag directory, it will be 
considered valid. 

### Special files: summary and closing

There are two special files that can be added to assist with changelog rendering. These are:
`summary.md` and `closing.md`. These files can be added or modified at any time, and should
contain valid markdown. When the changelog is rendered, the summary will be included at the 
top, before the list of changes, and the closing notes will be included at the end. 

## Changelog validation

When changelogs are enabled, PRs must include a valid changelog file or they will fail verification 
and cannot be merged. 

The changelog file must be included in the correct directory according to semver. For example, if the 
last released version was `v0.2.5`, new PRs that don't create breaking changes should add changelog 
files into `v0.2.6` (they should create the directory if it does not yet exist). If the PR contains 
a breaking change entry, it should create or rename the existing directory to `v0.3.0`. 

For projects that have already released `v1.0.0`, breaking changes should increment the major version 
instead (`v2.0.0`). Non-breaking changes should increment the minor version (`v1.1.0`).

## Releasing a stable v1.0 version

There is one special case for incrementing versions: publishing a stable 1.0 API. This can be done 
by setting the `releaseStableApi` field to true. 

```yaml
changelog: 
  - ...
  . ...
releaseStableApi: true 
``` 

## Publishing release notes to Github

Changelogs will automatically be rendered into a markdown string, and the CI release bot will 
immediately update a release description to be the changelog when a release is published. 
No manually entered description should be used (it will get overwritten). 

### Rendering notes

Changelogs for a tag are merged and rendered in the following order:

- Summary
- Dependency bumps
- Breaking changes
- Upgrade notes
- Helm changes
- New Features
- Fixes
- Closing

If the contents for a section are empty, it is omitted. 

A breaking change, upgrade note, helm change, new feature, or fix are rendered in the following way: `<description> (<issueLink>)`

Non-user facing changes are omitted from the changelog. If there are no user-facing changes in a release, 
the rendered notes will just say: 

> This release contained no user-facing changes.

## Pushing release notes and docs to Solo Docs

This changelog can be pushed automatically to the docs using the [PushDocsCli](../docsutils/README.md).
