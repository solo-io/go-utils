// ONLY COMPILES ON LINUX
// most often you will want to wrap the code being tested (i.e., f()) in a for loop to get more sizeable readings.
// use this function over built-in benchmarker (https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#benchmark_tests) to measure time
// using the OS user-time specific to the executing thread. This _should_ help with noisy neighbors in ci/locally.
//
// other things to note while benchmarking:
//   - I've noticed the google cloudbuild hardware matters a lot, using nonstandard hardware (e.g. `N1_HIGHCPU_8`)
//     has helped improve reliability of benchmarks
//   - we could still explore running tests with nice and/or ionice
//   - could also further explore running the tests with docker flags --cpu-shares set
