    description: >
      Update versionutils to support a 4th digit, release candidate, on versions. Update the regex to optionally match on vX.X.X-rcX. 
      Relax changelog incrementing validation to always allow incrementing to an rc release. Allow incrementing from 1.0.0-rc1 to 1.0.0
      by using `releaseStableApi`. In the future, we can generalize this flag to support migrating to any non-rc release.
