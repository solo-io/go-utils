      Ensure the SecurityScanner scans all images for a set of minor versions.
      Previously, the scanner would only scan the latest patch release, which would cause docs which depend
      on these scans (as Gloo Edge does) to show empty scans.

    resolvesIssue: true
    description: >
      Expose a new option 'CreateGithubIssueForLatestPatchVersion', which when enabled, will ensure that the
      SecurityScanner only creates Github issues to track the latest patch version as opposed to creating
      an issue for every version (which it has historically done)
