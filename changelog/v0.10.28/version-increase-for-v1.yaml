changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
    The version utils currently always bump the minor version for any non-breaking change. We need to update the logic to
    ensure that if a changelog entry is of type `BREAKING_CHANGE` we must bump the major version, if it is of type
    `NEW_FEATURE` we must bump the minor version, and else we have to bump the patch version.
