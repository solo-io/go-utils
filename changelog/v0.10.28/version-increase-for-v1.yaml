changelog:
- type: FIX
  description: >
    When verifying changelog entries after the v1.0.0 release, the version utils currently require a minor version bump
    for any non-breaking change. We need to update the logic to ensure that if a changelog entry is of type
    `BREAKING_CHANGE` we must bump the major version, if it is of type `NEW_FEATURE` we must bump the minor version,
    and else we have to bump the patch version.
