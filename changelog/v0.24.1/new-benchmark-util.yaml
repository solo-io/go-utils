  issueLink: https://github.com/solo-io/go-utils/issues/511
  description: >
    Added the `Measure` function to the `benchmarking` test utility package. 
    The new function measures the portion of time a given test function spent in user mode, 
    in kernel mode, and on both of them combined. The other functions in the same package have been deprecated
    and will be removed when other repositories will stop depending on them.
