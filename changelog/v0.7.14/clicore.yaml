      Introduce a utility for managing zap logs from a CLI tool. The new `clicore`
      library provides a means of sending human-friendly log messages to the console
      while capturing full json-formatted logs to a file. Library includes a pair of
      `Run` methods for siplified execution of the "main" file and simplified output
      validation during integration tests.

    description: >
      The `PrintTrimmedStack` fail handler simplifies error tracking in ginkgo tests
      by printing a condensed stack trace upon failure. Printout excludes well-known
      overhead files so you can more easily sight the failing line. This eliminates
      the need to count stack offset via `ExpectWithOffset`. You can just use
      `Expect`.
