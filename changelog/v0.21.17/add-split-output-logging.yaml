      When the SPLIT_LOG_OUTPUT environment variable is specified, a global logger is created with the following characteristics:
      debug/info/warning are written to stdout, error/fatal/panic are written to stderr
      Configuration is otherwise identical to the default logger
      When SPLIT_LOG_OUTPUT is unspecified, logging configuration is unchanged
