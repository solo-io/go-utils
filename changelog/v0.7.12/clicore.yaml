    description: >
      Introduce a utility for managing zap logs from a CLI tool. The new `clicore`
      library provides a means of sending human-friendly log messages to the console
      while capturing full json-formatted logs to a file. Library includes a pair of
      `Run` methods for siplified execution of the "main" file and simplified output
      validation during integration tests.
