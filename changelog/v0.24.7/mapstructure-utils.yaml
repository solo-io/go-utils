changelog:
  - type: NON_USER_FACING
    description: >
      Normalizes and decodes map interfaces that can have (deeply nested) numbers of type json.Number
      by setting those to either to int64 or float64.

      Usually you don't need to normalize a map[string]interface{}, that you are decoding into a struct with mapstructure
      Unless, you will use it with `structpb.NewValue()` which doesn't handle that type and throws an invalid type error.
