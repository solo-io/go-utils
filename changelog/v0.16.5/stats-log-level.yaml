changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: >
    Add a new `LogLevel` startup option to inject the `zap.AtomicLevel` into the stats server. This way clients can
    build their own logger and use the stats server to change its log level at runtime, instead of having to rely on
    the logger built internally by the server.
